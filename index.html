        </p>
        <p>
            Wᴇsᴛ Zᴡᴇɪᴡᴏᴏᴅ Tᴇᴄʜᴍᴀᴛɪᴄs has been designing, producing, and manufacturing high-end mechanical and microelectronic products for nearly half a century. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            Founded in 1969 by engineer brothers Tim and Chris Zweiwood, we&rsquo;ve been on the pulse of the industry ever since, and stayed dedicated to our mission of creating everything from bespoke, small-batch gadgets to huge numbers of high-quality products. 
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            Since inception, we&rsquo;ve <em>never</em> had a product line we weren&rsquo;t able to deliver on time, even in the face of
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Extreme weather
            </li>

                Communication difficulties
            </li>
            <li>
                Cat/manufacturing pipeline incidents*
            </li>

            and other <em>insurmountable</em> odds.

            What&rsquo;re We Up To?
        </h2>
        <p>
            Here at WZT, we&rsquo;ve been focused on our <strong>widget-manufacturing</strong> process to deliver proven widget implementation to consumers and business like you. Since 1970, our production line has been churning out blue and orange widgets at the rate of <em>700 thousand units a month!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the difficulty in securing line space for productions like this, get in touch with us <a href="#" >here</a> to discuss the process for bringing your widget plans into the real world, or for a consultation about our widget production pipeline.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
            Along with advances in the widget manufacturing pipeline, we&rsquo;re proud of our work on the <strong>microelectronic-retro-turboencabulator</strong>, a new advancement in <abbr title="Microelectromechanical systems">MEMS</abbr> grammeter Skor-motion stabalisation, and inverse reactive current detection. 
        </p>
        <p>
            We&rsquo;ve been able to bring this microelectronic-retro-turboencabulator to market at a fraction of the cost of other high-end retro-turboencabulators, with guaranteed stator efficiency improvements of up to <em>70%</em> over traditional retro-encabulation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You can find more information about our lines of microelectronics <a href="#">here</a>, or more about our microelectronic- and retro-turboencabulators <a href="#">here</a>.
